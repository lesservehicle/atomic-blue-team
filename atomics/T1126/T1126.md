# T1126 - Network Share Connection Removal
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1126)
<blockquote>Windows shared drive and [Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1077) connections can be removed when no longer needed. [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) is an example utility that can be used to remove network share connections with the <code>net use \\system\share /delete</code> command. (Citation: Technet Net Use)

Adversaries may remove share connections that are no longer useful in order to clean up traces of their operation.</blockquote>
