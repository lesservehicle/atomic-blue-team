# T1135 - Network Share Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1135)
<blockquote>Networks often contain shared network drives and folders that enable users to access file directories on various systems across a network. 

### Windows

File sharing over a Windows network occurs over the SMB protocol. (Citation: Wikipedia Shared Resource) (Citation: TechNet Shared Folder)

[Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) can be used to query a remote system for available shared drives using the <code>net view \\remotesystem</code> command. It can also be used to query shared drives on the local system using <code>net share</code>.

Adversaries may look for folders and drives shared on remote systems as a means of identifying sources of information to gather as a precursor for Collection and to identify potential systems of interest for Lateral Movement.

### Mac

On Mac, locally mounted shares can be viewed with the <code>df -aH</code> command.</blockquote>
