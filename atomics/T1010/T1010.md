# T1010 - Application Window Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1010)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of open application windows. Window listings could convey information about how the system is used or give context to information collected by a keylogger.

In Mac, this can be done natively with a small [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1155) script.</blockquote>
