## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1136)
<blockquote>Adversaries with a sufficient level of access may create a local system or domain account. Such accounts may be used for persistence that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

The <code>net user</code> commands can be used to create a local or domain account.</blockquote>
