# T1083 - File and Directory Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1083)
<blockquote>Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system. 

### Windows

Example utilities used to obtain this information are <code>dir</code> and <code>tree</code>. (Citation: Windows Commands JPCERT) Custom tools may also be used to gather file and directory information and interact with the Windows API.

### Mac and Linux

In Mac and Linux, this kind of discovery is accomplished with the <code>ls</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>locate</code> commands.</blockquote>
