# T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1049)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying for information over the network. 

### Windows

Utilities and commands that acquire this information include [netstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0104), "net use," and "net session" with [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039).

### Mac and Linux 

In Mac and Linux, <code>netstat</code> and <code>lsof</code> can be used to list current connections. <code>who -a</code> and <code>w</code> can be used to show which users are currently logged in, similar to "net session".</blockquote>
