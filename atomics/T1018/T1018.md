# T1018 - Remote System Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1018)
<blockquote>Adversaries will likely attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used. 

### Windows

Examples of tools and commands that acquire this information include "ping" or "net view" using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039).

### Mac

Specific to Mac, the <code>bonjour</code> protocol to discover additional Mac-based systems within the same broadcast domain. Utilities such as "ping" and others can be used to gather information about remote systems.

### Linux

Utilities such as "ping" and others can be used to gather information about remote systems.</blockquote>
