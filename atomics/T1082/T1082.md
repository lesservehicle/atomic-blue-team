# T1082 - System Information Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1082)
<blockquote>An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture.

### Windows

Example commands and utilities that obtain this information include <code>ver</code>, [Systeminfo](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0096), and <code>dir</code> within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) for identifying information based on present files and directories.

### Mac

On Mac, the <code>systemsetup</code> command gives a detailed breakdown of the system, but it requires administrative privileges. Additionally, the <code>system_profiler</code> gives a very detailed breakdown of configurations, firewall rules, mounted volumes, hardware, and many other things without needing elevated permissions.</blockquote>
